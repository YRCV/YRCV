Hello! My name is Yahil Corcino and I am studying for a B.S. Computer Engineering at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.

I'm very interested in the intersection of software and electronics to create things that make lives better/easier or are ouright cool.
That's why I've decided to dive into projects related to embedded systems, IoT, and robotics.
